<br>

"📱 Excited to announce the successful completion of task 1 in the @LetsGrowMore virtual internship, where i successfully built an Android app - COVID-19 Tracker India! 🇮🇳

 ℹ This app provides up-to-date information on COVID-19 cases across all states and cities in India, sourced from a reliable API using Volley Library. With a sleek interface and powerful features, users can easily:

📍 View a comprehensive list of all states in India.
🔍 Search for specific cities within each state. 
📊 Access detailed statistics on total, active, deceased, and recovered COVID-19 cases in each city.

🚀 Developed using the latest Android technologies and integrating with an API, this app aims to empower users with accurate information.

Looking Forward to complete the further tasks and gaining experiences in this internship.
